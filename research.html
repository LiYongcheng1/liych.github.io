    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are often contaminated by electromyographic (EMG) artifacts, especially when recording during movement. Existing methods to remove EMG artifacts include independent component analysis (ICA), and other high-order statistical methods. However, these methods can not effectively remove most of EMG artifacts. Here, we proposed a modified ICA model for EMG artifacts removal in the EEG, which is called EMG Removal by Adding Sources of EMG (ERASE). In this new approach, additional channels of real EMG from neck and head muscles (reference artifacts) were added as inputs to ICA in order to “force” the most power from EMG artifacts into a few independent components (ICs). The ICs containing EMG artifacts (the “artifact ICs”) were identified and rejected using an automated procedure. ERASE was validated first using both simulated and experimentally-recorded EEG and EMG. Simulation results showed ERASE removed EMG artifacts from EEG significantly more effectively than conventional ICA. Also, it had a low false positive rate and high sensitivity. Subsequently, EEG was collected from 8 healthy participants while they moved their hands to test the realistic efficacy of this approach. Results showed that ERASE successfully removed EMG artifacts (on average, about 75% of EMG artifacts were removed when using real EMGs as reference artifacts) while preserving the expected EEG features related to movement. We also tested the ERASE procedure using simulated EMGs as reference artifacts (about 63% of EMG artifacts removed). Compared to conventional ICA, ERASE removed on average 26% more EMG artifacts from EEG. These findings suggest that ERASE can achieve significant separation of EEG signal and EMG artifacts without a loss of the underlying EEG features. These results indicate that using additional real or simulated EMG sources can increase the effectiveness of ICA in removing EMG artifacts from EEG. Combined with automated artifact IC rejection, ERASE also minimizes potential user bias. Future work will focus on improving ERASE so that it can also be used in real-time applications.</p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Recent studies have shown the ability to record high-γ signals (80–160 Hz) in electroencephalogram (EEG) from traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients who have had hemicraniectomies. However, extraction of the movement-related high-γ remains challenging due to a confounding bandwidth overlap with surface electromyogram (EMG) artifacts related to facial and head movements. In our previous work, we described an augmented independent component analysis (ICA) approach for removal of EMG artifacts from EEG, and referred to as EMG Reduction by Adding Sources of EMG (ERASE). Here, we tested this algorithm on EEG recorded from six TBI patients with hemicraniectomies while they performed a thumb flexion task. ERASE removed a mean of 52 ± 12% (mean ± S.E.M) (maximum 73%) of EMG artifacts. In contrast, conventional ICA removed a mean of 27 ± 19% (mean ± S.E.M) of EMG artifacts from EEG. In particular, high-γ synchronization was significantly improved in the contralateral hand motor cortex area within the hemicraniectomy site after ERASE was applied. A more sophisticated measure of high-γ complexity is the fractal dimension (FD). Here, we computed the FD of EEG high-γ on each channel. Relative FD of high-γ was defined as that the FD in move state was subtracted by FD in idle state. We found relative FD of high-γ over hemicraniectomy after applying ERASE were strongly correlated to the amplitude of finger flexion force. Results showed that significant correlation coefficients across the electrodes related to thumb flexion averaged ~0.76, while the coefficients across the homologous electrodes in non-hemicraniectomy areas were nearly 0. After conventional ICA, a correlation between relative FD of high-γ and force remained high in both hemicraniectomy areas (up to 0.86) and non-hemicraniectomy areas (up to 0.81). Across all subjects, an average of 83% of electrodes significantly correlated with force was located in the hemicraniectomy areas after applying ERASE. After conventional ICA, only 19% of electrodes with significant correlations were located in the hemicraniectomy. These results indicated that the new approach isolated electrophysiological features during finger motor activation while selectively removing confounding EMG artifacts. This approach removed EMG artifacts that can contaminate high-gamma activity recorded over the hemicraniectomy.</p></div>

    Abstract

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>We propose the architecture of a novel robot system merging biological and artificial intelligence based on a neural controller connected to an external agent. We initially built a framework that connected the dissociated neural network to a mobile robot system to implement a realistic vehicle. The mobile robot system characterized by a camera and two-wheeled robot was designed to execute the target-searching task. We modified a software architecture and developed a home-made stimulation generator to build a bi-directional connection between the biological and the artificial components via simple binomial coding/decoding schemes. In this paper, we utilized a specific hierarchical dissociated neural network for the first time as the neural controller. Based on our work, neural cultures were successfully employed to control an artificial agent resulting in high performance. Surprisingly, under the tetanus stimulus training, the robot performed better and better with the increasement of training cycle because of the short-term plasticity of neural network (a kind of reinforced learning). Comparing to the work previously reported, we adopted an effective experimental proposal (i.e. increasing the training cycle) to make sure of the occurrence of the short-term plasticity, and preliminarily demonstrated that the improvement of the robot’s performance could be caused independently by the plasticity development of dissociated neural network. This new framework may provide some possible solutions for the learning abilities of intelligent robots by the engineering application of the plasticity processing of neural networks, also for the development of theoretical inspiration for the next generation neuro-prostheses on the basis of the bi-directional exchange of information within the hierarchical neural networks.</p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Precision electronics which can provide multi-channel stimulation capability is important part for neurorobotic and investigation of neuronal development and plasticity. Towards this end, an electrical stimulator designed for dissociated neurons on multi-electrode arrays (MEA) is present in this paper. The stimulator is mainly designed for online application in systems requiring simulation stimulation and recording signal from dissociated neurons on MEAs. The developed stimulator includes 64 independent channels, which are able to generate the arbitrary defined biphasic voltage waveform, controlled in real time with time resolution of 3us and amplitude resolution of 12 bits. The stimulator can generate three basic waveforms (rectangle, sine and triangle wave) in default. The amplitude of the output signal produced by this stimulator can achieve a very wide range. The preliminary experiments in which neuronal activities are evoked by this stimulator have been done. Moreover, the additional analysis of neuronal activities evoked by this stimulator will be present in this paper.</p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>State-of-the-art invasive brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have shown significant promise, but rely on external electronics and wired connections between the brain and these external components. This configuration presents health risks and limits practical use. These limitations can be addressed by designing a fully implantable BMI similar to existing FDA-approved implantable devices. Here, a prototype BMI system whose size and power consumption are comparable to those of fully implantable medical devices was designed and implemented, and its performance was tested at the benchtop and bedside. Approach. A prototype of a fully implantable BMI system was designed and implemented as a miniaturized embedded system. This benchtop analogue was tested in its ability to acquire signals, train a decoder, perform online decoding, wirelessly control external devices, and operate independently on battery. Furthermore, performance metrics such as power consumption were benchmarked. Main results. An analogue of a fully implantable BMI was fabricated with a miniaturized form factor. A patient undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation with an electrocorticogram (ECoG) grid implanted over the primary motor cortex was recruited to operate the system. Seven online runs were performed with an average binary state decoding accuracy of 87.0% (lag optimized, or 85.0% at fixed latency). The system was powered by a wirelessly rechargeable battery, consumed  ~150 mW, and operated for more than 60 h on a single battery cycle. Significance. The BMI analogue achieved immediate and accurate decoding of ECoG signals underlying hand movements. A wirelessly rechargeable battery and other supporting functions allowed the system to function independently. In addition to the small footprint and acceptable power and heat dissipation, these results suggest that fully implantable BMI systems are feasible. </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) translate brain signals into control signals for an external device, such as a computer cursor or robotic limb. These signals can be obtained either noninvasively or invasively. Invasive recordings, using electrocorticography (ECoG) or intracortical microelectrodes, provide higher bandwidth, more informative signals. Rehabilitative BMIs, which aim to drive plasticity in the brain to enhance recovery after brain injury, have almost exclusively used non-invasive recordings, such electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), which have limited bandwidth and information content. Invasive recordings provide more information and spatiotemporal resolution, but do incur risk, and thus are not usually investigated in people with stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we describe a new BMI paradigm to investigate the use of higher frequency signals in brain-injured subjects without incurring significant risk. We recorded EEG in TBI subjects who required hemicraniectomies (removal of part of the skull). EEG over the hemicraniectomy (hEEG) contained substantial information in the high gamma frequency range (65-115 Hz). Using this information, we decoded continuous finger flexion force with moderate to high accuracy (variance accounted for 0.06 to 0.52), which at best approaches that using epidural signals. These results indicate that people with hemicraniectomies can provide a useful resource for developing BMI therapies for the treatment of brain injury.</p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Simultaneous acquisition of brain activity signals from the sensorimotor area using NIRS combined with EEG, imagined hand clenching force and speed modulation of brain activity, as well as 6-class classification of these imagined motor parameters by NIRS-EEG were explored. Near infrared probes were aligned with C3 and C4, and EEG electrodes were placed midway between the NIRS probes. NIRS and EEG signals were acquired from 6 healthy subjects during 6 imagined hand clenching force and speed tasks involving the right hand. The results showed that NIRS combined with EEG is effective for simultaneously measuring brain activity of the sensorimotor area. The study also showed that in the duration of (0, 10) s for imagined force and speed of hand clenching, HbO first exhibited a negative variation trend, which was followed by a negative peak. After the negative peak, it exhibited a positive variation trend with a positive peak about 6–8 s after termination of imagined movement. During (-2, 1) s, the EEG may have indicated neural processing during the preparation, execution, and monitoring of a given imagined force and speed of hand clenching. The instantaneous phase, frequency, and amplitude feature of the EEG were calculated by Hilbert transform; HbO and the difference between HbO and Hb concentrations were extracted. The features of NIRS and EEG were combined to classify 3 levels of imagined force (at 20/50/80 % MVGF (maximum voluntary grip force)) and speed (at 0.5/1/2 Hz) of hand clenching by SVM. The average classification accuracy of the NIRS-EEG fusion feature was 0.74 ± 0.02. These results may provide increased control commands of force and speed for a brain-controlled robot based on NIRS-EEG.</p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>In recent years, many studies examined if EEG signals from traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients can be used for new rehabilitation technologies, such as BCI systems. However, extraction of the high-gamma band related to movement remains challenging due to the presence of surface electromyogram (sEMG) caused by unconscious facial and head movement of patients. In this paper, we proposed a modified independent component analysis (ICA) model for EMG artifact removal in the EEG data from TBI patients with a hemicraniectomy. Here, simulated EMG was generated and added to the raw EEG data as the extra channels for independent components calculation. After running ICA, the independent components (ICs) related to artifacts were identified and rejected automatically through several criteria. EEG data underlying hand movement from one healthy subject and one TBI patient with a hemicraniectomy were conducted to verify the efficacy of this algorithm. Results showed that the proposed algorithm removed sEMG artifacts from the EEG data by up to 86.72% while preserving the associated brain features. In particular, the high-gamma band (80 to 160 Hz) was found to arise principally from the hemicraniectomy area after this technique was applied. Meanwhile, we found that the magnitude of gamma power during movement improved after removal of sEMG artifacts.</p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>The neuronal networks are considered as the origin of intelligence in organisms. In this paper, a new hybrid neurorobot system merging the biological intelligence to the artificial intelligence was created. It was based on a neuronal controller bi-directionally connected to an actual mobile robot implementing a novel vehicle which was aimed at searching objects. The modified software architecture and home-made stimulation generator were employed to support a bi-directional exchange of information between the biological and the artificial part by means of simple binomial coding/decoding schemes. Eventually, the dissociated neuronal network could be successfully employed to control an artificial agent to find the objects. And the robot performed better and better along with the times of trials in one experiment because of the short-term plasticity. A new framework was provided to investigate the biological-artificial bi-directional interfaces for the development of innovative strategies for brain-machine interaction in these simplified model systems.</p></div>
